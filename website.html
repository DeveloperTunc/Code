    <div class="container-1">
    <p class="header-para">Welcome to my website where i try to learn more about programming</p>
    
    <p>Here i learn about HTML,CSS,JS and how it all comes together to provide a functioning website.</p>
    <p>Design of webpage looks bad, colors doesn't really match but i will worry about that later.</p>
    <p>For now i will focus more on functionality.</p>
    <p>I added border to every element to understand the box model how inline and block levels work and try to understand the flexbox model how can i position elements in a box so that they wouldn't collide with each other</p>

        <div class="container-2-1"><h2>Front End</h2>
            <p>Front-End or Client-Side is where user interacts with provided webpage.When a user asks for some data, Front-End sends a request to Back-End, Back-End processes the data usually from its database and responses the relevant data to Front-End.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides website the skeleton architecture</li>
                    <li>Images, headers, links,SEO optimization , titles,included files, forms are some of its important aspects </li>
                </ul>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides website the much needed design.Styling colors, images, links , everything you see on the web page designed and positioned by CSS.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>JS</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript adds the functionality to the webpage.We can design buttons with CSS and HTML but the button needs to actually do something which is provided by JS.JS can also make DOM manipulations to manipulate how webpage interacts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container-2-2"><h2>Back End</h2>
            <p>Back-End or Server-Side is where magic happens when it comes to manipulating data.If i wanted to do a TO-DO app i would need to handle get requests to show all the queries in a list.If i wanted to update that list Back-End is where i would need to write the logic for that.Server-Side is where database models are defined.Back-End handles request that comes from Front-End processes data gets data from database if necessary and sends a response back to Front-End.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Python can handle requests and responses , interact with database, define business logic.</li>
